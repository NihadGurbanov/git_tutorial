	<h1>My Machine Learning Projects Portfolio </h1>
	<h2>Image Classification with Deep Learning</h2>
	<p>In the "Image Classification with Deep Learning" project, I leveraged the power of deep learning to develop an accurate image classification system. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, I trained the model on a diverse dataset of images across multiple categories. The project achieved an impressive accuracy rate, accurately classifying images into their respective classes. The trained model's performance was further enhanced by techniques like data augmentation and fine-tuning, demonstrating my proficiency in computer vision and deep learning. This project showcases my ability to tackle complex image recognition tasks and provides valuable insights into the world of deep neural networks.</p>
	<h2>Sentiment Analysis for Text Data</h2>
	<p>"Sentiment Analysis for Text Data" is a project that focused on analyzing the sentiment expressed in textual data. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and libraries, I developed a sentiment analysis model capable of categorizing text as positive, negative, or neutral. The project included data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, and model selection to achieve high accuracy in sentiment classification. Visualizations like word clouds and precision-recall curves were incorporated to illustrate the model's performance. This project highlights my expertise in NLP and text analysis, showcasing my ability to extract meaningful insights from unstructured text data.</p>
	<h2>Predictive Modeling for Housing Prices</h2>
	<p>In the "Predictive Modeling for Housing Prices" project, I created a predictive model for estimating housing prices based on a rich dataset containing various attributes such as square footage, location, and amenities. Leveraging regression algorithms like Linear Regression and Decision Trees, I built a robust model capable of making accurate predictions. The project involved data exploration, feature engineering, and model evaluation, resulting in a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing housing prices. Interactive visualizations, such as scatter plots and heatmaps, were utilized to showcase the model's performance and provide valuable insights for potential buyers and sellers. This project underscores my proficiency in predictive modeling and data-driven decision-making.</p>
	<h3>These completed projects not only demonstrate my technical skills in machine learning and data analysis but also showcase my ability to tackle real-world challenges and derive meaningful insights from data. They serve as a testament to my dedication and expertise in the field of data science and machine learning.</h3>
